## About

This repository contains the project "0x02. C - Functions, nested loops". The project is about learning and understanding the concepts of functions and nested loops in C programming.

## File Descriptions

- `0-putchar.c`: This file contains a program that prints "Holberton", followed by a new line. The program uses the function `_putchar`, which writes a character to stdout.
- `1-alphabet.c`: This file contains a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- `2-print_alphabet_x10.c`: This file contains a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- `3-islower.c`: This file contains a function that checks for lowercase character. It returns 1 if the character is lowercase, and 0 otherwise.
- `4-isalpha.c`: This file contains a function that checks for alphabetic character. It returns 1 if the character is a letter, lowercase or uppercase, and 0 otherwise.
- `5-sign.c`: This file contains a function that prints the sign of a number. It returns 1 and prints + if the number is greater than zero, returns 0 and prints 0 if the number is zero, and returns -1 and prints - if the number is less than zero.
- `6-abs.c`: This file contains a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
- `7-print_last_digit.c`: This file contains a function that prints the last digit of a number. It returns the value of the last digit.
- `8-24_hours.c`: This file contains a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
- `9-times_table.c`: This file contains a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
- `10-add.c`: This file contains a function that adds two integers and returns the result.
- `100-times_table.c`: This file contains a function that prints the `n` times table, starting with 0, where `n` is an input to the function.
- `101-natural.c`: This file contains a program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024.
- `102-fibonacci.c`: This file contains a program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2.
- `104-fibonacci.c`: This file contains a program that prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2.
