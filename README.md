# Holberton School Low Level Programming

This repository contains projects for Holberton School's low-level programming track. These projects are designed to provide a deep understanding of the C programming language, as well as covering the concepts of Linux programming, data structures, algorithms, and more.

## Repository Structure

This repository is structured as follows:

- Each directory corresponds to a project wherein there exists my solution(s) to one or more specific tasks.
- Each project directory contains a README.md file that provides a detailed description of the project, the concepts it covers (where applicable), and descriptions of all the files.

## Projects
