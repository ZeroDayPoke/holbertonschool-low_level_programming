# 0x0A - Argc, Argv

## Synopsis

In this project we covered the various prototypes for our main files, and how to utilize them, in preparation for our printf clone project

## File Descriptions

### Mandatory

- `0-whatsmyname.c`: This file contains a program that prints its name, followed by a new line. If you rename the program, it will print the new name, without having to compile it again. The path should not be removed before the name of the program.
- `1-args.c`: This file contains a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.
- `2-args.c`: This file contains a program that prints all arguments it receives.
- `3-mul.c`: This file contains a program that multiplies two numbers. The program prints the result of the multiplication, followed by a new line. If the program does not receive two arguments, it prints `Error`, followed by a new line, and returns `1`.
- `4-add.c`: This file contains a program that adds positive numbers. If no number is passed to the program, it prints `0`, followed by a new line. If one of the number contains symbols that are not digits, the program prints `Error`, followed by a new line, and returns `1`.
