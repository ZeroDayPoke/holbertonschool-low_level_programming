# 0x18. C - Doubly linked lists

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum. In this project, you will learn about doubly linked lists in C programming.

## Synopsis

This project covers:

- What is a doubly linked list
- How to use doubly linked lists

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`

## File Descriptions

### Mandatory

- `0-print_dlistint.c`: This file contains a function that prints all the elements of a `dlistint_t` list.
- `1-dlistint_len.c`: This file contains a function that returns the number of elements in a linked `dlistint_t` list.
- `2-add_dnodeint.c`: This file contains a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a `dlistint_t` list.
- `3-add_dnodeint_end.c`: This file contains a function that adds a new node at the end of a `dlistint_t` list.
- `4-free_dlistint.c`: This file contains a function that frees a `dlistint_t` list.
- `5-get_dnodeint.c`: This file contains a function that returns the nth node of a `dlistint_t` linked list.
- `6-sum_dlistint.c`: This file contains a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a `dlistint_t` linked list.
- `8-delete_dnodeint.c`: This file contains a function that deletes the node at index `index` of a `dlistint_t` linked list.
- `9-print_dlistint_backward.c`: This file contains a function that prints all the elements of a `dlistint_t` list in reverse order.
