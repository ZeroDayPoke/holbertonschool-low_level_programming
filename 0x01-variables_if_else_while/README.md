# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

This directory contains files created in response to tasks set forth in Holberton student project "0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while". These scripts demonstrate a basic introduction to C programming, specifically related to variables of type `char`, `int`, and `unsigned int`, ASCII characters, and control flow basics (if, if...else, while, for).

## File Descriptions

### Files

#### Task 0: [0-positive_or_negative.c](./0-positive_or_negative.c)

* A C program that assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed, and prints whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative.

#### Task 1: [1-last_digit.c](./1-last_digit.c)

* A C program that assigns a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed, and prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`.

#### Task 2: [2-print_alphabet_x10.c](./2-print_alphabet_x10.c)

* A C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line, 10 times.

#### Task 3: [3-print_alphabets.c](./3-print_alphabets.c)

* A C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.

#### Task 4: [4-print_alphabt.c](./4-print_alphabt.c)

* A C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line, excluding the letters `q` and `e`.

#### Task 5: [5-print_numbers.c](./5-print_numbers.c)

* A C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line.

#### Task 6: [6-print_numberz.c](./6-print_numberz.c)

* A C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function.

#### Task 7: [7-print_tebahpla.c](./7-print_tebahpla.c)

* A C program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.

#### Task 8: [8-print_base16.c](./8-print_base16.c)

* A C program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.

#### Task 9: [9-print_comb.c](./9-print_comb.c)

* A C program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, separated by a comma and a space.

#### README: [README.md](./README.md)

* Current README file.

#### Task 10: [100-print_comb3.c](./100-print_comb3.c)

* A C program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits, separated by a comma and a space. The two digits must be different and the combinations should be printed in ascending order.

#### Task 11: [101-print_comb4.c](./101-print_comb4.c)

* A C program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits, separated by a comma and a space. The three digits must be different and the combinations should be printed in ascending order.

#### Task 12: [102-print_comb5.c](./102-print_comb5.c)

* A C program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers, separated by a comma and a space. The combinations should be printed in ascending order.
