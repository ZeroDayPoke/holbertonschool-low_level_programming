# 0x13. C - More Singly Linked Lists

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum. In this project, you will learn more about singly linked lists in C programming.

## Synopsis

This project covers:

- How to use linked lists
- Potential issues with linked lists (advanced)

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`

## File Descriptions

### Mandatory

- `0-print_listint.c`: This file contains a function that prints all the elements of a `listint_t` list.
- `1-listint_len.c`: This file contains a function that returns the number of elements in a linked `listint_t` list.
- `2-add_nodeint.c`: This file contains a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a `listint_t` list.
- `3-add_nodeint_end.c`: This file contains a function that adds a new node at the end of a `listint_t` list.
- `4-free_listint.c`: This file contains a function that frees a `listint_t` list.
- `5-free_listint2.c`: This file contains a function that frees a `listint_t` list and sets the head to `NULL`.
- `6-pop_listint.c`: This file contains a function that deletes the head node of a `listint_t` linked list, and returns the head nodeâ€™s data (n).
- `7-get_nodeint.c`: This file contains a function that returns the nth node of a `listint_t` linked list.
- `8-sum_listint.c`: This file contains a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a `listint_t` linked list.
- `9-insert_nodeint.c`: This file contains a function that inserts a new node at a given position.
- `10-delete_nodeint.c`: This file contains a function that deletes the node at index `index` of a `listint_t` linked list.

### Advanced

- `100-reverse_listint.c`: This file contains a function that reverses a `listint_t` linked list.
- `101-print_listint_safe.c`: This file contains a function that prints a `listint_t` linked list, safely.
- `102-free_listint_safe.c`: This file contains a function that frees a `listint_t` list, safely.
- `103-find_loop.c`: This file contains a function that finds the loop in a linked list.
