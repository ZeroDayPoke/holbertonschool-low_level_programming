# 0x08. C - Recursion

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum. In this project, you will learn about recursion in C programming.

## Synopsis

This project covers:

- What is recursion
- How to implement recursion
- In what situations you should implement recursion
- In what situations you shouldnâ€™t implement recursion

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`

## File Descriptions

### Mandatory

- `0-puts_recursion.c`: This file contains a function that prints a string, followed by a new line. The function uses recursion to achieve this.
- `1-print_rev_recursion.c`: This file contains a function that prints a string in reverse. The function uses recursion to achieve this.
- `2-strlen_recursion.c`: This file contains a function that returns the length of a string. The function uses recursion to achieve this.
- `3-factorial.c`: This file contains a function that returns the factorial of a given number. The function uses recursion to achieve this.
- `4-pow_recursion.c`: This file contains a function that returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y`. The function uses recursion to achieve this.
- `5-sqrt_recursion.c`: This file contains a function that returns the natural square root of a number. The function uses recursion to achieve this.
- `6-is_prime_number.c`: This file contains a function that checks if a number is a prime number. The function uses recursion to achieve this.

### Advanced

- `100-is_palindrome.c`: This file contains a function that checks if a string is a palindrome. The function uses recursion to achieve this. It includes a helper function `_strlen_r` to calculate the length of the string and `paliPower` to recursively determine if the string is a palindrome.
- `101-wildcmp.c`: This file contains a function that compares two strings, considering the wildcard character `*`. The function uses recursion to achieve this. It returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, and 0 otherwise.
