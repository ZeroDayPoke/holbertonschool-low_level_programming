# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

This directory contains files created in response to tasks set forth in Holberton student project "0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops". These scripts demonstrate a foundational understanding of nested loops, and how to use them in the C programming language.

## Project Requirements

- Code must be compiled with `-Wall` `-Werror` `-Wextra` `-pedantic` `-std=gnu89`
- Cannot use `system`, `printf`, `puts`, etc. Allowed to use `_putchar`
- No longer than 40 lines per function

## File Descriptions

- `0-isupper.c`: This file contains a function that checks for uppercase character. Returns 1 if the character is uppercase, 0 otherwise.
- `1-isdigit.c`: This file contains a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9). Returns 1 if the character is a digit, 0 otherwise.
- `2-mul.c`: This file contains a function that multiplies two integers and returns the result.
- `3-print_numbers.c`: This file contains a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
- `4-print_most_numbers.c`: This file contains a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, except 2 and 4, followed by a new line.
- `5-more_numbers.c`: This file contains a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.
- `6-print_line.c`: This file contains a function that draws a straight line in the terminal, the line should be n characters long.
- `7-print_diagonal.c`: This file contains a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal, the diagonal should be n characters long.
- `8-print_square.c`: This file contains a function that prints a square, followed by a new line. The function takes an integer as an argument and prints a square of that size using the `#` character.
- `9-fizz_buzz.c`: This file contains a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`.
- `10-print_triangle.c`: This file contains a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line. The function takes an integer as an argument and prints a triangle of that size using the `#` character.
- `100-prime_factor.c`: This file contains a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line. The program is allowed to use the standard library.
- `101-print_number.c`: This file contains a function that prints an integer. The function uses `_putchar` function to print each digit of the number. The function handles negative numbers and implements its own `printf` function to print the number.
